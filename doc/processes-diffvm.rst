.. title:: Diffractive production of vector mesons ùõΩ

Diffractive vector meson production
===================================

The :math:`ep`-induced :math:`\gamma^{(\ast)}\Pom\rightarrow` vector meson production process may be selected from the ``diffvm`` label.
It was designed for HERA physics cases, hence the asymmetric electron-proton initial beam kinematics.

Process-specific options
------------------------

-  ``vmFlavour``: PDG id of the VM produced
-  ``vmMode``: vector meson production mode,
   ``protonMode``: proton side emission type

   -  ``BeamMode.GluonFragmentation := -1``
   -  ``BeamMode.Elastic := 0``
   -  ``BeamMode.StandardFragmentation := 1``
   -  ``BeamMode.NucleonPionsDecay := 2``

-  ``photonMode``: photon emission type

   -  ``PhotonMode.Fixed := -1``
   -  ``PhotonMode.InvK := 0``
   -  ``PhotonMode.WWA := 1``
   -  ``PhotonMode.ABTSmith = 2``
   -  ``PhotonMode.AandS := 3``

Furthermore, the following parameters can be steered in this process:

``slopeParameters``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``wb0`` is the :math:`w _ {\gamma p}` centre-of-mass energy (in GeV) at which ``b0`` :math:`=b_0` was measured
-  ``amxb0`` is the mass :math:`M_X` of the diffractively dissociating hadronic system :math:`X` for which :math:`b_0` was measured
-  ``anexp`` is a power-law exponent

``pomeronParameters``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``epsilonW`` and ``epsilonM`` are controlling the intercept of the pomeron trajectory (minus 1).
   The first one steers the rise of :math:`\sigma _ {\gamma p}` with :math:`W`, while the second controls the :math:`M_X` spectrum
-  ``alpha1`` and ``alpha1m`` control the pomerons trajectory‚Äôs :math:`\alpha'` (therefore, expressed in GeV¬Ø¬≤)

``vmParameters``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  ``lambda`` and ``eprop`` control the :math:`Q^2`-dependence of the
   total production cross section, through

.. math::

   \sigma(Q^2) = \sigma_0\left(1 + Q^2/\Lambda^2\right)^{-\epsilon _ {\rm prop}}

-  ``xi`` and ``chi`` control the behaviour of the
   longitudinal-to-transverse cross section ratio through

.. math::

   \frac{\sigma_L(Q^2)}{\sigma_T(Q^2)}=\frac{\xi Q^2/m^2}{1+\xi\chi Q^2/m^2}.

.. note::
   In this scheme, :math:`\sigma_L/\sigma_T\to\xi Q^2/m^2` for
   low-\ :math:`Q^2`, and :math:`1/\chi` for high-\ :math:`Q^2`.

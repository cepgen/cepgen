# $\kt$-factorised $\ggff$ process

The photon transverse momentum-dependant description of this process was previously developed in `PPtoLL`, and described in {cite}`daSilveira:2014jla`.
It is defined as the `pptoll` process in CepGen.

## Process-specific options

### `method`

This integer allows to switch between the two matrix element definitions:

- `0`: on-shell amplitude,
- `1`: off-shell amplitude.

### `mode`

This enumeration allows to specify the kinematic regime to generate and the size of the phase space to perform the integration.
It can take the following values:

- `ProcessMode.ElasticElastic := 1`: elastic emission of photons from the incoming protons (default value if unspecified),
- `ProcessMode.ElasticInelastic := 2 / ProcessMode.InelasticElastic := 3`: elastic scattering of one photon and an inelastic/semi-exclusive emission of the other photon, resulting in the excitation/fragmentation of the outgoing proton state,
- `ProcessMode.InelasticInelastic := 4`: both protons fragmented in the final state.

### `pair`

This integer value allows the end-user to specify the PDG identifier of the fermion pair to be produced in the final state.

It can take the following values:

- `PDG.electron := 11`: $e^+e^-$ pair production
- `PDG.muon := 13`: $\mu^+\mu^-$ pair production
- `PDG.tau := 15`: $\tau^+\tau^-$ pair production
- `PDG.down`, `PDG.up`, `PDG.strange`, `PDG.charm`, `PDG.bottom`, `PDG.top` (or equivalently `1-6`): quark pair production.

```{title} LPAIR's two-photon production of fermion pair
```

# LPAIR’s $\ggll$

The full description of this $pp \rightarrow p^{(\ast)}(\ggll)p^{(\ast)}$ process as previously implemented in `LPAIR` {cite}`Baranov:1991yq` can be reached through the `lpair` process in CepGen.
A phenomenological review of both this process and its first implementation in `LPAIR` may be found in {cite}`Vermaseren:1982cz`.

## Process-specific options

### `mode`

This enumeration allows to specify the kinematic regime to generate and the size of the phase space to perform the integration.
It can take the following values:

- `ProcessMode.ElasticElastic := 1`: elastic emission of photons from the incoming protons (default value if unspecified),
- `ProcessMode.ElasticInelastic := 2 / ProcessMode.InelasticElastic := 3`: elastic scattering of one photon and an inelastic/semi-exclusive emission of the other photon, resulting in the excitation/fragmentation of the outgoing proton state,
- `ProcessMode.InelasticInelastic := 4`: both protons fragmented in the final state.

### `pair`

This integer value allows the end-user to specify the PDG identifier of the lepton to be produced in the final state.
It can hence take the following values:

- `PDG.electron := 11` for the $e^+e^-$ pair production,
- `PDG.muon := 13` for the $\mu^+\mu^-$ pair production, and
- `PDG.tau := 15` for the $\tau^+\tau^-$ pair production.

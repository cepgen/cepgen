     * Full class of methods and objects to compute the full analytic matrix element
     * \cite Vermaseren1983347 for the \f$\gamma\gamma\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\f$ process
     * according to a set of kinematic constraints provided for the incoming and
     * outgoing particles (the Kinematics object).
     * The particle roles in this process are defined as following: \n
     * \image latex lpair_kinematics.pdf Detailed particle roles in the two-photon process as defined by the @a GamGamLL object. The incoming protons/electrons are denoted by a role 1, and 2, as the outgoing protons/protons remnants/ electrons carry the indices 3 and 5. The two outgoing leptons have the roles 6 and 7, while the lepton/antilepton distinction is done randomly (thus, the arrow convention is irrelevant here).
     *
     * The \a f function created by this Process child has its \a _ndim -dimensional
     * coordinates mapped as :
     * - 0 = \f$t_1\f$, first incoming photon's virtuality
     * - 1 = \f$t_2\f$, second incoming photon's virtuality
     * - 2 = \f$s_2\f$ mapping
     * - 3 = yy4 = \f$\cos\left(\pi x_3\right)\f$ definition
     * - 4 = \f$w_4\f$, the two-photon system's invariant mass
     * - 5 = xx6 = \f$\frac{1}{2}\left(1-\cos\theta^\text{CM}_6\right)\f$ definition (3D rotation of the first outgoing lepton with respect to the two-photon centre-of-mass system). If the @a nm_ optimisation flag is set this angle coefficient value becomes 
     *   \f[\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{a_\text{map}}{b_\text{map}}\frac{\beta-1}{\beta+1}+1\right)\f]
     *   with \f$a_\text{map}=\frac{1}{2}\left(w_4-t_1-t_2\right)\f$, \f$b_\text{map}=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\left(\left(w_4-t_1-t_2\right)^2-4t_1t_2\right)\left(1-4\frac{w_6}{w_4}\right)}\f$, and \f$\beta=\left(\frac{a_\text{map}+b_\text{map}}{a_\text{map}-b_\text{map}}\right)^{2x_5-1}\f$
     *   and the \a fJacobian element is scaled by a factor \f$\frac{1}{2}\frac{\left(a_\text{map}^2-b_\text{map}^2\cos^2\theta^\text{CM}_6\right)}{a_\text{map}b_\text{map}}\log\left(\frac{a_\text{map}+b_\text{map}}{a_\text{map}-b_\text{map}}\right)\f$

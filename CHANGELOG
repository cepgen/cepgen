* Thu Jul 25 2019 <laurent.forthomme> 0.9.7
- Fortran processes can now be fed a generic set of parameters, thanks to additional getter functions
- Output handlers may now be constructed directly from steering cards, thus enhancing overall modularity.
- Added a helper for the retrieval of events properties through human-readable getters
- New output handlers: text (raw text output, and ASCII histograms), HepMC ASCII output (for HepMC v<3),
  ROOT histogram collections and ntuple files writers
- In addition, added an interface to Delphes for the simulation of detectors effects
- Refactored HepMC event builder in preparation for future developments
* Thu Jul 11 2019 <laurent.forthomme> 0.9.6
- Added support of Pythia6 hadronisation/fragmentation algorithm for legacy tests
- Structure functions parameterisation objects polished
- New output modes handled for HepMC interfacing module
* Tue Jun 25 2019 <laurent.forthomme> 0.9.5
- Increased flexibility in particles (and their associated properties) definitions
- Small corrections in the LPAIR process definition of the output kinematics
- Improved Pythia8 interfacing, better handling of the LHEF output format when remnants dissociation is triggered
- Better exceptions handling
* Thu May 9 2019 <laurent.forthomme> 0.9.4
- pptoff polarisation terms may be steered for off-shell ME
- Functional is now handling exprtk in addition to muParser
- Refactored exceptions and tests
- Improved accessors for integrator/grid definition
- Better memory management for parameters/processes/hadronisers definition
* Fri Nov 30 2018 <laurent.forthomme> 0.9.1-3

- New structure functions definitions: ALLM (+subsequent), MSTW grid, CLAS, LUXlike, LHAPDF
- Introduced R-ratio definitions for F_L calculation from F_2
- New cuts definition
- Better memory management
* Thu Aug 24 2017 <laurent.forthomme> 0.8
- Major refactoring of the code
- Dropped the hadronisers and other unfinished processes definition for clarity
- Several bug fixes and memory management improvements through the usage of smart pointers / C++11 migration
- Taming functions introduced
* Tue May 3 2016 <laurent.forthomme> 0.7
- Introduced a generic templating class for the k_T factorisation method
- Added a placeholder for the gamma gamma -> W+ W- process computation

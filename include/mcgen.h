/**
 * This object represents the core of this Monte Carlo generator, with its
 * allowance to generate the events (using the embedded Vegas object) and to
 * study the phase space in term of the variation of resulting cross section
 * while scanning the various parameters (point \f$\textbf{x}\f$ in the
 * DIM-dimensional phase space).
 *
 * The phase space is constrained using the InputParameters object given as an
 * argument to the constructor, and the differential cross-sections for each
 * value of the array \f$\textbf{x}\f$ are computed in the f-function defined
 * outside (but populated inside) this object.
 *
 * This f-function embeds a GamGam object which defines all the methods to
 * obtain this differential cross-section as well as the in- and outgoing
 * kinematics associated to each particle.
